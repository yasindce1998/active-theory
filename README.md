# Mohammed Yasin · Immersive WebGL Portfolio

Security engineer working on kernel-level offense and cloud-native defense. This portfolio is a real-time WebGL 2 experience: open-source projects sit on a curved 3D ribbon you can drag and fling, with liquid-displacement shaders, a GPU fluid sim, synthesized Web Audio, and full case-study views. It has no dependencies, no build step, and no external assets.

```bash
npm start            # or: node server.js, ./start.sh, start.bat
```

Open **http://localhost:7890**. Drag to explore, click a card to open its case study, use the arrow keys to step between projects, and press **G** for the live parameter panel.

## Content

All portfolio content is in [`public/js/config.js`](public/js/config.js):

| Export | What it drives |
| :--- | :--- |
| `OWNER` | Name, role, location/timezone (header clock), contact links |
| `PROJECTS` | The ribbon cards and their case studies: title, tagline, category, status, GitHub URL, tags, accent color, and the terminal log lines drawn on each card |
| `EXPERIENCE` | Experience timeline in the About modal |
| `CLIENT_WORK` | Proprietary client work listed in the About modal |

To add a project, append an entry to `PROJECTS` and add a matching `drawProjectArt` branch in [`cards.js`](public/js/cards.js) for its schematic. Projects without a branch get the default radar art.

## Features

- **Category filters** (`ALL / OFFENSE / DEFENSE / RESEARCH`): filtered-out cards shrink and fade off the ribbon, and dragging, arrow keys and pagination only cycle through the visible set.
- **Deep links**: `/#/<project-id>` (e.g. `/#/neurontrace`) jumps to that project and opens its case study once you enter. The hash updates as case studies open and close.
- **Security-console card art**: every card is drawn procedurally on a canvas, with scan lines, terminal logs, and a schematic for its domain (agent toolchain, ring-0 mirror, container breakout, syscall fence, boot chain, eBPF↔WASM bridge, rogue-tower radar).
- **SEO**: Open Graph / Twitter meta tags and JSON-LD `Person` structured data.

## Deploying to Vercel

The site is fully static. Everything lives in `public/`. `vercel.json` serves `public/` as-is, rewrites extensionless routes to `index.html`, and adds basic security headers.

```bash
npx vercel          # preview deployment
npx vercel --prod   # production
```
